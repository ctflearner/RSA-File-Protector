##  Running the RSA Encryption and Decryption Program.

```markdown
1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file.
3. Run the  file by typing “python <keygeneration>.py” and press enter. This will execute the Python script and it will generate the public and private key
4. Then Run the file by typing "python <encryption>.py" and press enter. This will execute the Python script .
5. The program will prompt you to enter whether you want to encrypt a file or folder.
6. Enter "f" to encrypt a single file or "d" to encrypt a folder.
7. If you entered "f", you will be prompted to enter the file path of the file you want to encrypt.
8. If you entered "d", you will be prompted to enter the folder path of the folder you want to encrypt.
9. The program will then encrypt the file(s) or folder and save them as a new file(s) with a .encrypted extension.
10. To decrypt a file or folder, run the "decryption.py" file in the same way you ran the encryption file, and follow the prompts to enter the file or folder path of the encrypted file(s) or folder(s) you want to decrypt.
11. The program will decrypt the file(s) or folder(s) and save them in their original location without the .encrypted extension.
